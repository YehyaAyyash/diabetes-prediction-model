# diabetes-prediction-model
Machine Learning model to predict diabetes using Logistic Regression, SVC, and Random Forest

# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Model

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict whether a person has diabetes based on medical attributes.

## 📌 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains medical information such as glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, age, and a target variable indicating diabetes status.

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Data Loading (from Excel – second sheet)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data Preprocessing & Feature Scaling
4. Model Training
5. Model Evaluation
6. Model Comparison

## 🤖 Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Random Forest Classifier

## 📈 Results
| Model | Accuracy |
|------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | ~75% |
| Random Forest | ~72% |
| SVC | ~73% |

## 🔍 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
- Cross Validation

## 📁 Files
- `Diabetes_Prediction_Model.ipynb` – Main notebook
- `Diabetes_Prediction_Model.pdf` – Exported report

## 🚀 Future Improvements
